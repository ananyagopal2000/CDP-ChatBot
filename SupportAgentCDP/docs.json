Suggest Edits Introduction Vault is a centralized hub for managing security and other administrative features in Lytics. It provides a single place for Lytics admins to access and change their key security features and user permissions, regardless of product. This means that the controls set in Vault apply to Conductor, Decision Engine, Cloud Connect, and any other products associated with your Lytics account. Take a quick tour of Lytics Vault. Navigating Vault Vault is comprised of the following sections: Account Usage - an overview of your general account quota usage related to event consumption. Account Settings - view and change necessary administrative settings and details of your account. These are sectioned into the following categories. Account Details JavaScript Tag Lytics API Content Security Schema Users - view a list of users accessing your Lytics account, change their details or permissions, remove a user, or invite a new user to the account. Security Access Tokens - view and manage a list of Lytics API access tokens. New tokens can be provisioned with specific permissions. Authorizations - create, edit, view, and delete authorizations within Lytics. Authorizations are credentials to third parties that enable the necessary scopes and permissions for data import and export jobs to run. Account Setup JavaScript Tag - learn how to install the Lytics JavaScript tag and validate the installation. Who can access Vault? Vault is focused primarily on account admins or those that have permission to administer settings, user access, etc. Based upon these permissions, your experience in Vault may vary, and all sections outlined above may not be available. \ud83d\udcd8 If you are unable to access a section please reach out to your account administrator to request those adjusted permissions. In general, Admins will be able to access all areas. Data Managers, Campaign Managers, Experience Managers, and Goal Managers can access the Authorizations section to manage the credentials for their jobs and experiences. Finally, all Lytics users, regardless of role, should have access to view the JavaScript tag installation page under Account Setup, and they should be able to view their user profile where they can change details such as their Name, Email Address, Phone Number (for two-factor authentication) and change their password. Your user profile will be accessible under the main Lytics navigation under \"Manage My Profile.\" Notable Changes For existing customers, slight changes will impact your day-to-day management activities. Product Switcher Vault will be available directly from the primary product switcher at the top left of your Lytics interface. This will be your primary access point for account management from now on. Account Usage Our account usage data and quota meters received a much-needed facelift. The usage metrics act as the Vault \"dashboard\" for admin users. Account Settings Account setting sections are now accessible through the main navigation. These settings have received a minor facelift update. The form controls for multi-text fields have been slightly updated for a more standard user experience. In addition, users are now prompted to save or discard their changes when navigating away from these pages with unsaved settings. Users The user list is now sortable and filterable based on name, email, who invited them, and how long they've been a Lytics user. Each user has a page to view their details and roles. In Vault, in addition to assigning new roles, an administrator can edit any user's name and email address. The user invite form is now on its page to improve the flow and experience of inviting users. Roles are now sorted into two categories - Admin or Custom Roles. An admin inherently has access to everything, while custom roles give a finer-grain definition of what the user can access. The details on each role are shown in a tooltip when you hover over the role name. Access Tokens The access tokens list is now sortable and filterable based on the name, description, the creator of the token, or when/if it has expired. You can now view additional details about the access tokens you've already created, such as the roles assigned, when it was made, and when it will expire. In addition, new access tokens can now be assigned as an admin or with any combination of more granular access roles. Authorizations Authorizations are now to be created and updated only in Vault. You will still be able to utilize the auths you create in Vault in other products, but for example, when creating a job in Conductor or Decision Engine, if you don't see an authorization you want to use for that job, you will be linked into the authorizations wizard within Vault to create the auth. JavaScript Tag Installation This page remains unchanged, with simple styling changes and updated links to our documentation for troubleshooting.

You can edit your account name, domain, and primary contact email from this page anytime. Once you change one of these values, you will be prompted to save or undo the changes. Account ID and account number are never editable. They are assigned at account creation and are permanent identifiers. Navigating Accounts For users who have access to multiple accounts, you can quickly and securely navigate between Accounts using our account switcher at the bottom right of the primary navigation: 1. Click \"Switch Account\" 2. Select Account A menu will appear outlining the accounts you have access to. Simply select an account and a new tab will open with this accounts dashboard.

Suggest Edits Monitoring Monitoring and alerting is available on every job and every authorization within Lytics. To set up alerting on your jobs or authorizations, you can set up a monitoring job from either the Job API or the Lytics UI for alerting to Slack , Microsoft Teams , or directly to email . If a source or destination job has failed, Lytics will show the latest error message on the Conductor Diagnostics Dashboard and on the Logs tab of the Source/Destination Job Summary interface, and allow the job to be restarted if needed. The most detailed information for troubleshooting can be accessed from the Job Logs API Additional generic monitoring on the Lytics system is available on our status page at lytics.statuspage.io .

Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance. Lytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels. The goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To achieve this, we've broken our approach into three components: Our Approach Define: Relationships Between Identifiers Profile definition is the first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements. To build a strong identity resolution strategy, three key questions must be answered: How important is accuracy? How do you define and manage the strength of each identifier to ensure profiles are materialized properly? How can the materialized profiles be analyzed and delivered to other tools? Construct: Complex Profiles Data is messy. Lytics' Profile Materialization provides a necessary cleansing & polishing layer atop the defined resolution strategy. This ensures what is surfaced is accurate and accessible and enables your team to accelerate impact. Answering the following two key questions guarantee profiles represent the ideal marketable entity: What attributes should be surfaced on profiles for segmentation, and does the data need to be normalized at all? What rules should be used to maintain profile integrity? Maintain: Accurate & Compliant Profiles Over time profiles will bloat, attributes will become stale, and use cases become more complex. If unmanaged, a quality identity strategy will begin breaking down the moment it is implemented. Lytics prevents your identity strategy from breakdown through a set of powerful tools focused on ensuring the following profile health-related questions have concrete answers: How can you validate the health of your ID resolution strategy over time? What is the process for managing consent? How long is a profile relevant if it no longer has a means of being updated? What is the life expectancy of expirable IDs, such as browser cookies? Advanced Concepts The Lytics Identity Graph Behind each Lytics profile is an identity graph.  This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source. To create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or more identity keys that identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called an identity fragment .  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected When evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.  Some identity graphs are significant and represent complex relationships in the data. In contrast, other identity graphs are small and describe a small interaction, like an anonymous cookie from a single-visit, incognito browser. Graph Mechanics As you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons \u2013 new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment. However, we're not satisfied with several singletons \u2013 our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc. In graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragm\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://docs.lytics.com/docs/consent\nConsent & Privacy For more information on Lytics' security and privacy program, please visit Lytics' trust center at https://trust.lytics.com/ Suggest Edits Introduction As businesses continue to collect and utilize customer data to power their marketing efforts, obtaining, managing, and enforcing proper consent is crucial. This is important for complying with various privacy laws and regulations and maintaining trust with customers. This document will explore the importance of granularity in a consent strategy and how Lytics can assist in the consent management process. We will cover best practices to consider and provide guidance on where to get started. The following four steps will be outlined: Data Collection : How to collect consent adequately from disparate sources consistently. Profile Materialization : How to flexibly surface the state of consent to individual user profiles. Segmentation : How can the required consent rules be enforced when driving downstream campaigns? Maintenance : How to ensure that your consent strategy scales and flexes to your ongoing market conditions without fail? By following these steps, businesses can establish a solid and effective consent management strategy that respects customer privacy and builds trust. Data Collection To maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, businesses need a clear and flexible path for collecting consent data. Lytics offers a range of SDKs and data collection APIs to support this effort. When approaching consent data collection, it is essential to consider the following: The source of the data and any inherent limitations. Can it be real-time, or does it need to be batch? The granularity of the consent. Is this a simple boolean, on or off, or is this something more granular, like opting into a particular communication method? Additional context related to the consent that may be important for your needs. Are there specific forms that are being consented to or a unique source? To address these considerations, Lytics has developed a suggested schema to get you started. Of course, this can always be customized via Conductor to meet your specific needs. Data Structure Effective consent management requires a comprehensive set of properties that can be deployed to ensure compliance and maintain customer trust. These properties should cover various aspects of data collection, storage, and usage and provide businesses with the tools to manage consent-related data effectively. Schema Property Description Event Name Using a standardized event name for consent collection provides crucial context that can be utilized through if/else rules for individual mappings. By leveraging different event names, such as \"consent-type-1\" versus \"consent-type-2,\" it becomes easier to differentiate between multiple types of consent on a single profile as events stream in and is subsequently mapped. This approach enables businesses to maintain a more granular and organized record of consent-related data. Consented A clear and concise confirmation, or lack thereof, reduces the possibility of accidentally mapping consent when consent has been denied or not yet collected. Location An optional parameter to build context around a user's location that may become important. Are they consenting to something location specific? Date An optional parameter to build context around when consent was most recently given. Date may be important if consent is valid for a specified length of time and may help support efforts to gather consent in the event that the consent timeframe has lapsed. Documents The \"documents\" array within the default schema represents additional context that can be used to specify the source of consent. For instance, this field can indicate whether the consent was given via a global site-wide agreement or a specific call to action during a purchase. While the data manager determines the values and format of this field, including this information helps ensure that critical context is not lost during execution. Examples \ud83d\udcd8 We are here to help! Consent is not a one size fits all scenario. Each customers data and business goals are unique. Before deploying any of the following examples it is always recommended to consult with your Technical Account Manager or a Solutions Architect. Lytics deploys a flexible data model, and though the following is not representative of every method of collection, we've highlighted two working examples leveraging our available SDKs as a baseline: Collecting Consent via the Web: Lytics JavaScriptTag JavaScript jstag.send({\n  \"event\": \"form-submit\",\t\n  \"consent\": {\n    \"purpose\": \"global\",\n    \"location\": \"Portland, OR\",\n    \"documents\": [\"generic-submit-form\"],\n    \"consented\": true\n  }\n}) Collecting Consent via Mobile: Lytics iOS SDK Lytics.shared.consent(\n  name: \"consent-1\",\n  identifiers: AnyCodable([\n    \"userid\": \"my-fake-userid-1234\"\n  ]),\n  attributes: AnyCodable([\n    \"firstName\": \"Kevin\",\n    \"lastName\": \"McCalister\"\n  ]\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://docs.lytics.com/docs/client-server-side-cookie-deep-dive\nClient & Server Side Cookies Everything you wanted to know about cookies from client side to server side. Suggest Edits What is a Cookie An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser\u2014keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol. Cookie Flavors First-party First-party cookies are created by the host domain \u2013 the domain the user is visiting. These cookies are generally considered good; they help provide a better user experience and keep the session open. This means the browser can remember key information, such as items you add to shopping carts, username, and language preferences. Third-party Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats. Common Cookie Use Cases Session management Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember. Personalization User preferences, themes, and other settings. Tracking Recording and analyzing user behavior. How does Lytics use cookies? Cookies are one of the preferred methods for maintaining a user identifier in the browser, both known and anonymous. This gets associated with all inbound events captured by our Javascript tag as they interact with customer websites. Specifically, our Javascript tag stores a string of digits and characters that are used as a unique ID commonly referred to as our _uid or, in some cases seerid as a first-party cookie. Creating & Managing Cookies Where do cookies come from? Client-Side In web development, the client-side refers to everything in a web application displayed on the client (end-user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions an application performs within the user's browser. When someone refers to a \u201cclient-side cookie,\u201d they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and/or managed via a common client-side programming language such as Javascript. Server Side Like with client-side, server-side means everything that happens on the server instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server-side, including rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications. When someone refers to a \u201cserver-side cookie,\u201d they are generally referring to a cookie that is created and managed using one of the many common server-side programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, Python, etc. Cookie Ingredients Name Defines the cookie name. Generally, the cookie name is the primary way of retrieving a cookie and its associated value and attributes. Value The stored value for the cookie. This can include any US-ASCII character excluding a control character, whitespace, double quotes, comma, semicolon, and backslash. Expires Indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. See Date for the required formatting. Max-Age Indicates the number of seconds until the cookie expires. A zero or negative number will expire the cookie immediately. Domain Defines the host to which the cookie will be sent. Path Indicates the path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the Cookie header. Secure This indicates that the cookie is sent to the server only when a request is made with the HTTPS: scheme (except on localhost) and, therefore, is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks . HttpOnly Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through the Document.cookie property. Note that a cookie created with HttpOnly will still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, for example, when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch() . This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting ( XSS ). SameSite Controls whether or not a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks ( CSRF ). Who\u2019s taking away my cookies?!? In June 2017, Apple introduced a new privacy feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) . This same feature was officially released in September 2017 with Safari 12 and iOS 11. Since then, the ITP has evolved and introduced several subsequent versions leading us to the current state (as of July 2022), which has many impacts on marketing but most notably: ITP blocks all third-party cookies by default. (ITP 1.0/1.1) ITP can grant exceptions to third-party cookies with Storage API. (ITP 2.0) ITP caps all first-party cookies set with JavaScript to 7 days or 24 hours. (ITP 2.1/2.2) ITP caps first-party cookies set by the server using CNAME cloaking to 7 days. (ITP 2.3) \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://docs.lytics.com/docs/pipeline\nData Pipeline Suggest Edits Welcome to the Pipeline & Profiles section, where we will explore data management and analysis fundamentals.
